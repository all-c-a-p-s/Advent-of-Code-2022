# Advent-of-Code-2022
Contains solutions in Go to part 2 of problems from Advent of Code 2022 (adventofcode.com/2022).

Definitely not the most efficient solutions to the problems but at least they work lol.

Mainly done to get experience with Go (reading from files, learning useful datatypes/conversions etc.)
